# What is this?
Currently it is a repo for my notes on computer graphics, and the basis for a
future render engine.

## Topics I need to study more:
- Vectors
    - Dot product
        - The unique geometric properties it has.
    - Cross product
        - What are the use cases.
            - Could become useful when we want to find the normal of the face of
              a polygon.

## Todo
- Matrices

## Resources
### Books
- C++ Game development by example...
