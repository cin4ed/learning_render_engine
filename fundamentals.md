## Types of coordinate systems
Assuming the positive X axis is to the right and positive Y axis is to the up
direction then teh Z axis can either **go into** or **comes out** of the screen
as the Z axis is perpendicular to both the X and Y axis.

If the positive Z axis moves into the screen, it is called a **Left Hand
Coordinate System**.

OpenGL, Vulkan or any graphics framework that use them also use this coordinate
system.

If the positive Z axis comes out of the screen, then it is called **Right Hand
Coordinate System**.

Direct3D of DirectX uses this coordinate system.
